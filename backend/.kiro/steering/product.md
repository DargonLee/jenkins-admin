# Product Overview

Jenkins Admin Backend is a FastAPI-based management service for Jenkins automation servers. The system provides a REST API layer for Jenkins operations with enhanced logging, monitoring, and database persistence.

## Core Features

- **Jenkins Integration**: Manage Jenkins jobs, builds, and configurations through REST APIs
- **Database Logging**: Persistent storage of operations and build history using PostgreSQL
- **Async Task Processing**: Background job processing with Celery and Redis
- **Security & Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access
- **Monitoring**: Built-in logging and metrics collection

## Target Use Cases

- Centralized Jenkins management across multiple instances
- Build automation and orchestration
- Audit logging and compliance tracking
- Integration with external systems and workflows

## API Design Philosophy

The API follows RESTful conventions with clear resource-based endpoints. All Jenkins operations are proxied through the backend service to provide additional logging, validation, and security layers.
